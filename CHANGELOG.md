# CHANGELOG

## 3.0.1

- Fix dependency com.obsidize.unity.range-input -> com.obsidize.range-input
  (Since apparently unity freaks out if "unity" is in the name of a non-unity
  package)
- Move samples out of the scope of this repo since they only serve to cause
  installation issues
- Normalize editor namespace from `Obsidize.FastNoise.EditorTools` ->
  `Obsidize.FastNoise.Editor`
- Fix misc issues with package declaration

## 3.0.0

- Add dependency com.obsidize.unity.range-input
- Remove internal MinMaxRange implementation in favor of new dependency
  implementation

## 2.3.2

- Fix editor tools assembly definition to only target editor platform
- Update Noise Terrain 3D Sample to be fully deployable

## 2.3.1

- Rename FastNoiseLiteUtility to the more appropriate FastNoiseLiteExtensions
- Replace hard-coded min (0f) and max (1f) values with shared constant
  references

## 2.3.0

  classes for better noise visualization support.

## 2.2.0
